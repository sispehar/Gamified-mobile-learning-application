# Gamified-mobile-learning-application
Diploma Thesis

Mobile learning is something that most people today use when using mobile devices, whether intentionally or unintentionally. 
In the first part of the thesis, we return to the beginnings of mobile learning and present what mobile learning actually is.
We also present various ways of accessing mobile learning content. Motivation in mobile learning activities plays an important role, 
since we want to keep it interesting for the users so they don't stop using it. The latter problem solves the so-called gamification. 
We continue describing the elements of gamification and, by way of example, show how we can integrate them into our system. 
We will describe the features of mobile devices that can be utilized for an even better user experience in our application. 
The second part of thesis is devoted to the development of a mobile learning application that uses elements of gamification. 
We will explain the development process of such a system, which technologies we have used and the operation of mobile and web application.
